Description: A Knowledge Base site that that allows users to read/create/update/delete two types of content: a process guide and a video walkthrough. Each type of content will belong to a specific business unit of a company. The data models are defined using Contentful, and content will be managed using Contentful's API.

Next Steps:
1. Further refine routing between /,/entries,/entry - Bonus: Route includes specific post/team/content as well
2. Finalize look and spacing of Navbar
3. Show actual entries
