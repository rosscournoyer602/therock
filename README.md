Description: A Knowledge Base site that that allows users to read/create/update/delete two types of content: a process guide and a video walkthrough. Each type of content will belong to a specific business unit of a company. The data models are defined using Contentful, and content will be managed using Contentful's API.

Next Steps:

1. Update Entries by rendering new form with pre-filled, on submit, delete old one and reupload new.
2. Render content completely
3. Display spinner while waiting for async requests to come back
4. Clear searchbar on enter
5. Create timestamp entries on contentful for deletions and edits (rudimentary update log)
